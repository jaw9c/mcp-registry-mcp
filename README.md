# MCP Registry Server

Avialble at: https://registry-mcp.remote-mcp.com

An MCP server that provides tools to search and retrieve information from the official MCP registry.

## Tools

- **ListMCPServers**: Search and list MCP servers from the registry with optional filtering
- **GetMCPServer**: Get detailed information about a specific MCP server

## Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy your MCP server to a URL like: `registry-mcp.remote-mcp.com`

## Connect to Cloudflare AI Playground

You can connect to your MCP server from the Cloudflare AI Playground, which is a remote MCP client:

1. Go to https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/
2. Enter your deployed MCP server URL (`remote-mcp-server-authless.<your-account>.workers.dev/sse`)
3. You can now use your MCP tools directly from the playground!

## Connect Claude Desktop to your MCP server

You can also connect to your remote MCP server from local MCP clients, by using the [mcp-remote proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote). 

To connect to your MCP server from Claude Desktop, follow [Anthropic's Quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) and within Claude Desktop go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config.

Update with this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "calculator": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8787/sse"  // or remote-mcp-server-authless.your-account.workers.dev/sse
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and you should see the tools become available.
